/* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    DIRECTIONS:
    Modify the "doStuff" function.
    
    Declare at least three integer variables and assign initial values to them.
    
    Perform the following calculations using the operators listed above, and display the results to the console.
    
    For each calculation, print a message describing the operation being performed and the result.

    1) Add two of the numbers together and display the result.
    2) Subtract one number from another and display the result.
    3) Multiply two numbers and display the result.
    4) Divide one number by another and display the result.
    5) Find the remainder when one number is divided by another and display the result.
    6) Create a small calculation where you combine at least three operators in a single expression.

    I provide you one variable and one output statement as an example.
    Notice that when you add a string and a number it will put them together as a string?

    NOTE: You should not "hard code" the output. 

    The output should look like this: 
        The sum of 10 and 5 is 15
        The result of subtracting 5 from 10 is 5
        The result of multiplying 10 by 3 is 30
        The result of dividing 10 by 5 is 2
        The remainder when dividing 10 by 3 is 1
        The result of (a + b) * c % b is 0
